            moisture, then pat dry with paper towels. </li>
        <li class="points points2">Warm olive oil in a skillet over high heat. Fry eggplant until browned, 2 to 3
            minutes per side. Drain on
            paper towels; set aside. </li>
        <li class="points">Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in ground beef,

        <li class="points points2">Add parsley, fines herbs, cinnamon, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Pour in tomato sauce
            and wine; mix well. Simmer

            and sprinkle another 1/2 cup cheese on top. </li>
        <li class="points">Pour béchamel sauce on top and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Cover with
