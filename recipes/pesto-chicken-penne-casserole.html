    <h2 class="small-header">Ingredients</h2>

    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li class="points">½ cup seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li class="points points2">½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li class="points">1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li class="points points2">1 (16 ounce) box penne pasta</li>
        <li class="points">6 cups cubed cooked chicken</li>
        <li class="points points2">4 cups shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
        <li class="points">3 cups fresh baby spinach</li>
        <li class="points points2">1 (15 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li class="points">1 (15 ounce) jar Alfredo sauce</li>
        <li class="points points2">1 (15 ounce) jar pesto sauce</li>
        <li class="points">1 ½ cups milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="small-header">Steps</h2>

    <ol class="steps">
        <li class="points">Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Combine the bread crumbs,
            Parmesan cheese, and olive oil in a small bowl until evenly moistened; set aside. </li>
        <li class="points points2">Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is
            boiling, stir in the penne, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the
            pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in
            the sink. </li>
        <li class="points">Meanwhile, combine the chicken in a bowl with the Italian cheese blend, spinach, tomatoes, alfredo sauce,
            pesto sauce, and milk. Stir in the pasta once done, and scoop into the prepared baking dish. Top with the
            bread crumb mixture. </li>
        <li class="points points2">Bake in the preheated oven until bubbly and golden brown on top, 40 to 45 minutes. </li>
    </ol>
